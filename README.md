a) Association Rule Generation: This project uses a transaction dataset provided by Rowan University. The dataset is called "Grocery_Items_60", and it is a csv file. Through this dataset, I uncovered rules that describe the relationships between different items.
b) CNN model-Bird sounds: This project uses bird sounds provided by the "VAST Challenge 2018 Mini-Challenge 1". These bird sounds are in a folder called "birdSounds", and each sound is in MP3 format. I made spectrograms of different class of birds (Bird sounds). Then, I elaborated a CNN model which classify each class
of birds according their spectograms.
c) Clustering Analysis of Dog Images:This project uses the "Stanford Dogs" dataset (dog pictures). In the first part of the project, it uses pictures from the folder "cropped100_dogs"; then, it resizes, and saves them into a folder called "cropped224_dogs". Through these pictures, I made a clustering analysis of 4 classes. The clustering analysis classifies each class of dog.
